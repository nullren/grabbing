# on a remote machine. options specified here are used directly with
# `scp`.
#
# if on your remote server, the directory `/srv/http/files/` corresponds
# to the web address <http://server/files/>, then set the following
# options to correspond to any scp command you would use to copy files
# to `/srv/http/files/`. eg:
#
#    scp -P 42222 dog.jpg user@server:/srv/http/files/

# making `dog.jpg` accessible at <http://server/files/dog.jpg>, then your
# options would be set as follows:

SCPOPTS="-P 42222"
SSHSTR="user@server"
